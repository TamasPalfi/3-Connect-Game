I worked on the assignment alone.

What works: all of the helper functions with comments "GOOD" work 100% completely, most simple test cases (mostly-filled board)

What kinda works: miniMax algorithm implementation - It should work on most cases, but on more complex boards it may
take a while to run (for needs to check whole tree), yet the solution should still be correct.  

What doesn't work: reading the file in from command may not work (could be args[1]) - I couldn't test that for my javac cmd 
didn't work from the command line and spent hours debugging it to no fix.   May be a problem with my personal machine.

*** Don't immediately give a 0 on the submission.  Please read the readme and the code and you will see that it is mostly fully
functional yet I have a single bug or two in miniMax which may cause it to fail more complex test cases.
